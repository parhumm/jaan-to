## Version History

For complete release history, see [CHANGELOG.md](../../CHANGELOG.md).

**Latest:** v3.18.0 — Add dev-api-contract skill

---

## Unreleased

- [x] Add `dev-api-contract` skill — OpenAPI 3.1 contract generation from API entities

---

## Phase 4: Development Workflow

> Details: [tasks/development-workflow.md](tasks/development-workflow.md) | [tasks/lsp-support.md](tasks/lsp-support.md)

- [ ] Project constitution document (`context/constitution.md`) — 9 immutable development principles
- [ ] Complexity tracking in outputs — `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]`, `[COMPLEXITY]`, `[EXCEPTION]`, `[TRADEOFF]` markers
- [ ] LSP support — Bundle TypeScript + Python language server configs, make skills LSP-aware

---

## Phase 5: Role Skills (137 across 11 roles)

> Details: [tasks/role-skills.md](tasks/role-skills.md)

137 skills cataloged across 11 roles. Quick-win skills (no MCP required) are built first, followed by advanced skills that depend on MCP connectors.

All new skills must follow v3.0.0 patterns: `$JAAN_*` environment variables, template variables, tech stack integration, and pass `/jaan-to:skill-update` validation.

| Role | Total | Quick Wins | Advanced | File |
|------|-------|------------|----------|------|
| PM | 23 | 17 | 6 | [pm.md](tasks/role-skills/pm.md) |
| DEV | 17 | 13 | 4 | [dev.md](tasks/role-skills/dev.md) |
| QA | 12 | 8 | 4 | [qa.md](tasks/role-skills/qa.md) |
| DATA | 14 | 8 | 6 | [data.md](tasks/role-skills/data.md) |
| GROWTH | 15 | 9 | 6 | [growth.md](tasks/role-skills/growth.md) |
| UX | 20 | 15 | 5 | [ux.md](tasks/role-skills/ux.md) |
| SEC | 4 | 4 | 0 | [sec.md](tasks/role-skills/sec.md) |
| DELIVERY | 8 | 8 | 0 | [delivery.md](tasks/role-skills/delivery.md) |
| SRE | 8 | 4 | 4 | [sre.md](tasks/role-skills/sre.md) |
| SUPPORT | 8 | 8 | 0 | [support.md](tasks/role-skills/support.md) |
| RELEASE | 8 | 8 | 0 | [release.md](tasks/role-skills/release.md) |

**Priority** (by research rank): qa-test-cases (#1), data-sql-query (#2), ux-research-synthesize (#8), qa-bug-report (#10), growth-meta-write (#12). Full priority list in [tasks/role-skills.md](tasks/role-skills.md#priority-order-by-research-rank).

---

## Phase 6: MCP Connectors (24 documented)

> Details: [tasks/mcp-connectors.md](tasks/mcp-connectors.md)

MCP connectors provide real system context to skills. Skills stay generic; MCP provides per-product data from actual tools.

- **Core MCPs (11)**: GA4, GitLab, Jira, Figma, GSC, Clarity, Sentry, BigQuery, Playwright, OpenAPI, dbt Cloud
- **Extended MCPs (13)**: Notion, Slack, GitHub, Linear, Mixpanel, Confluence, Snowflake, PostgreSQL, Ahrefs, Semrush, LambdaTest, Google Drive, Memory
- **Infrastructure**: Deferred loading for token savings, Context7 integration, model routing per skill type

---

## Phase 7: Testing and Polish

- [ ] E2E test framework in `tests/` with mocked MCP responses
- [ ] JSON export alongside markdown for all skill outputs
- [ ] External notifications (Slack integration)

---

## Phase 8: Distribution

> Details: [tasks/distribution.md](tasks/distribution.md)

- [x] Plugin marketplace installation (`/plugin marketplace add parhumm/jaan-to`)
- [ ] Multi-agent compatibility research (Cursor, Copilot, Windsurf, Gemini)
- [ ] CLI installer (`jaan-to-cli`) for one-command setup
- [ ] Public documentation site and branding guidelines

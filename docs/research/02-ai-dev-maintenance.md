# AI-Driven Development Maintenance

> Summary of: `deepresearch/dev-workflow/ai-dev-maintenance.md`

## Key Points

- **Spec-driven development**: Write detailed specifications before coding; AI follows specs for consistent implementation
- **Spec document structure**: Include purpose, inputs/outputs, constraints, edge cases, and acceptance criteria
- **Living documentation**: Keep specs updated as requirements evolve; AI can help maintain documentation
- **Test-first with AI**: Write test specifications first, then have AI implement to pass tests
- **Incremental complexity**: Start with simple features, add complexity gradually with AI assistance
- **Version control for specs**: Track specification changes alongside code changes
- **AI-assisted refactoring**: Use AI to refactor code while maintaining spec compliance
- **Validation loops**: Regular human review of AI-generated code against specifications

## Critical Insights

1. **Specifications are the contract** - Clear specs reduce ambiguity and improve AI output quality; vague specs lead to inconsistent results
2. **Human-AI collaboration cycle** - Humans define what, AI implements how, humans validate quality
3. **Documentation debt reduction** - AI can help maintain documentation that typically falls behind code

## Quick Reference

| Aspect | Recommendation |
|--------|---------------|
| Spec format | Markdown with clear sections |
| Minimum spec content | Purpose, I/O, constraints, acceptance criteria |
| Update frequency | With every significant code change |
| Review cycle | Human review after each AI implementation |
| Refactoring approach | Update spec first, then refactor code |

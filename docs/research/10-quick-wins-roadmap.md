# Claude Code Workflow Quick Wins Roadmap

> Summary of: `deepresearch/dev-workflow/claude-code-workflow-quick-wins-roadmap.md`

## Key Points

- **Phase 1 (Weeks 1-2)**: Layer B - Individual AI assistance with minimal setup
- **Phase 2 (Weeks 3-6)**: Layer C - CI/CD automation with Claude API integration
- **Phase 3 (Weeks 7-13)**: Layer D - Multi-system orchestration and governance
- **Role-specific quick wins**: Backend (test generation, rollout plans), Frontend (component planning, a11y), Product (story refinement, analytics)
- **Each quick win includes**: Trigger, input/output, implementation time, prerequisites, risks, human-in-loop
- **Stack alignment**: Self-hosted GitLab, GitLab CI, Jira, Telegram (ChatOps), GA4
- **Human ownership maintained**: AI is assistant, not decision-maker; humans approve all final outputs

## Critical Insights

1. **Progressive adoption reduces risk** - Start with low-effort/high-reward Layer B, prove value, then expand
2. **Role-specific targeting** - Different quick wins for backend, frontend, and product teams
3. **Guardrails are non-negotiable** - Every quick win includes explicit risk mitigation and human oversight

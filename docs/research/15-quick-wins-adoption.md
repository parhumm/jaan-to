# Quick Wins for Claude Code Adoption (Layers B-C-D)

> Summary of: `deepresearch/dev-workflow/quick-wins-claude-code-adoption-layers-bcd.md`

## Key Points

- **Layer B (Weeks 1-2)**: Team workflows - AI as co-pilot for planning, coding, testing with minimal setup
- **Layer C (Weeks 3-6)**: Automated pipelines - GitLab CI/GitHub Actions triggers Claude for code review, docs
- **Layer D (Weeks 7-13)**: Orchestration - ChatOps, codebase audits, cross-system coordination
- **Role-specific implementation**: Backend (Laravel/PHP), Frontend (React/Next.js), Product (Jira/GA4)
- **Each quick win documented**: Trigger, input/output, implementation time, prerequisites, risks, human-in-loop
- **Progressive complexity**: Start simple, prove value, expand scope
- **Guardrails mandatory**: AI assists, humans decide; no auto-merge or unsupervised changes

## Critical Insights

1. **Start with high-leverage, low-effort tasks** - Test generation and story refinement provide immediate ROI
2. **Role-specific adoption accelerates buy-in** - Backend, frontend, and product teams have different quick wins
3. **Human-in-the-loop is non-negotiable** - Every layer maintains human oversight and final decision authority

## About the Release Role

The `release` role covers the release iteration chain: tracking improvements, generating changelogs, and feeding support documentation. These skills bridge development work and user communication.

Release skills work with git history, Keep a Changelog formatting, and Semantic Versioning to produce human-friendly release documentation.

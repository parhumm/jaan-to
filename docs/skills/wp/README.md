## About the WordPress Role

The `wp` role covers WordPress-specific development workflows. WordPress plugin development has unique requirements — its own coding standards (WPCS), security functions (`esc_html()`, `$wpdb->prepare()`), hook-based architecture, and add-on ecosystem patterns that differ significantly from general PHP development.

Skills in this role encode WordPress-specific knowledge that goes beyond general code review or development tools.

# /dev-stack-detect (Deprecated)

> This skill has been replaced by the detect skills suite.

---

## Replacement

The `dev-stack-detect` skill has been merged into **`detect-dev`** as part of the Phase 5 detect skills:

| Old Skill | New Skill | What Changed |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| `/dev-stack-detect` | `/detect-dev` | Evidence-backed engineering audit with SARIF locations, 4-level confidence, OpenSSF scoring |

For a full repo analysis across all domains (dev, design, writing, product, UX), run:

```
/detect-pack
```

## About Research Synthesis

Research synthesis transforms raw UX research data (interviews, usability tests, surveys) into actionable insights using validated methodologies:

- **Braun & Clarke's 6-Phase Thematic Analysis**
- **Atomic Research Framework** (Facts → Insights → Recommendations)
- **Nielsen Severity Ratings** for prioritization
- **Impact × Effort Matrix** for recommendation classification

Three synthesis modes available:
- **Speed (1-2h)**: Quick findings from 3-5 sessions
- **Standard (1-2d)**: Full thematic analysis with 3-8 themes
- **Cross-Study**: Meta-analysis across multiple studies

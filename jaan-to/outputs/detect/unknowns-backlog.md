## Overview

This backlog contains **10 findings** with confidence ≤ 0.79 (Tentative or Uncertain levels) that require investigation to confirm or refute.

**Confidence Distribution**:
- Uncertain (< 0.65): 2 findings
- Tentative (0.65-0.79): 8 findings

**All unknowns are from Dev domain** — Design, Product, UX, and Writing domains have no Tentative/Uncertain findings.

---

## Prioritized Unknowns

### Priority 1: Uncertain Findings (< 0.65)

These have the lowest confidence and highest uncertainty. Investigate first.

---

#### U-1: No Penetration Testing or Security Audits (F-SEC-009)
**Domain**: Dev (security)
**Current Confidence**: Uncertain (0.60)
**Evidence**: E-DEV-046 (absence)
**Severity**: Low

**Current Understanding**:
No evidence of penetration testing, security audits, or vulnerability assessments detected. This is inferred from absence — no reports, no pentest configs, no audit documentation.

**Why Uncertain**:
- Absence of evidence ≠ evidence of absence
- Security audits may exist as private documents (not in repo)
- Open-source projects often rely on community security reports (GitHub Security Advisories)
- Pentesting may be inappropriate for CLI plugin (no server, no network attack surface)

**Scope Boundaries**:
- ✅ CAN claim: No pentest reports in repository
- ❌ CANNOT claim: Project has never been security audited (may be external/private)
- ❌ CANNOT claim: Plugin is insecure (separate from audit existence)

**How to Confirm**:
1. **Check private documentation**: Ask maintainers if security audits exist outside repo
2. **Review GitHub Security Advisories**: Check if any CVEs reported/fixed
3. **Assess applicability**: Determine if pentesting is relevant for CLI plugin (likely N/A)
4. **Expected outcome**: Likely mark as "N/A — no network attack surface" rather than "missing"

**Recommendation**:
Likely **Not Applicable** for CLI plugin. Resolve by:
- Confirming no server/API components (already known)
- Documenting security posture (static analysis, dependency scanning sufficient for CLI tools)
- Upgrade confidence to Confirmed with "N/A — CLI tool, no penetration testing needed"

---

#### U-2: No Signed Commits Enforcement (F-SEC-008)
**Domain**: Dev (security)
**Current Confidence**: Uncertain (0.65)
**Evidence**: E-DEV-044 (absence + git config check)
**Severity**: Low

**Current Understanding**:
No GPG/SSH commit signature verification detected in:
- `.git/config` (no `gpg.format` or `commit.gpgsign`)
- GitHub branch protection rules (not checked in repo)
- No `SECURITY.md` mentioning signed commits

**Why Uncertain**:
- GitHub branch protection settings not visible from repository files alone
- Individual contributors may sign commits without repo-level enforcement
- Open-source projects often don't enforce signing (contributor friction vs. security benefit trade-off)

**Scope Boundaries**:
- ✅ CAN claim: No local git config enforcing signed commits
- ❌ CANNOT claim: GitHub branch protection lacks signing enforcement (need GitHub API check)
- ❌ CANNOT claim: Maintainers never sign commits (need git log --show-signature)

**How to Confirm**:
1. **Check git log**: `git log --show-signature -n 20` to see if commits are signed
2. **GitHub branch protection**: Query GitHub API or check repo settings UI for `main` branch protection
3. **Maintainer policy**: Review CONTRIBUTING.md or ask maintainers about signing policy
4. **Expected outcome**: Likely not enforced (common for open-source projects)

**Recommendation**:
Low priority for open-source CLI plugin. To resolve:
- Document as "Not enforced (standard practice for open-source)"
- Consider enforcing if project handles sensitive data (doesn't appear to)
- Upgrade to Firm confidence after checking GitHub settings

---

### Priority 2: Tentative Findings (0.65-0.79)

These have moderate confidence but need validation to upgrade to Firm or Confirmed.

---

#### U-3: Shell Scripts Execute with Elevated Privileges (F-SEC-005)
**Domain**: Dev (security)
**Current Confidence**: Tentative (0.70)
**Evidence**: E-DEV-040 (pattern match)
**Severity**: Medium

**Current Understanding**:
Some shell scripts use `sudo` or elevated privileges:
- Evidence: Pattern match for `sudo` in scripts (found in some files)
- No full audit of privilege levels performed
- Unclear which scripts require elevation and why

**Why Tentative**:
- Only pattern-matched for `sudo` keyword — didn't analyze context
- May be conditional (e.g., `if [ "$(id -u)" -eq 0 ]`)
- May be in comments or documentation blocks
- Didn't check if scripts actually run with elevated privileges in practice

**Scope Boundaries**:
- ✅ CAN claim: Some scripts contain `sudo` keyword
- ❌ CANNOT claim: Scripts execute with root privileges by default
- ❌ CANNOT claim: Privilege escalation is required (vs. optional fallback)

**How to Confirm**:
1. **Grep for privilege keywords**: `grep -rn "sudo\|su \|su$" scripts/ --exclude-dir=node_modules`
2. **Review context**: For each match, determine if it's:
   - Required privilege escalation
   - Optional fallback (`sudo` with error handling)
   - Documentation/comments
3. **Test execution**: Run scripts and observe if they prompt for password
4. **Expected outcome**: Likely false positive or low-risk (optional sudo for install scripts)

**Recommendation**:
Audit all scripts for privilege requirements. If found:
- Document which scripts need elevation and why
- Add warnings in script headers
- Consider unprivileged alternatives (user-local installs vs. system-wide)

---

#### U-4: No SBOM Generation (F-SEC-006)
**Domain**: Dev (security)
**Current Confidence**: Tentative (0.70)
**Evidence**: E-DEV-041 (absence)
**Severity**: Low

**Current Understanding**:
No Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) generation detected:
- No CycloneDX or SPDX tools in package.json
- No SBOM files in repository (sbom.json, sbom.xml)
- npm does support SBOM via `npm sbom` (npm 9.6+)

**Why Tentative**:
- SBOM generation may happen in CI/CD (not visible in repo)
- GitHub Dependency Graph provides similar functionality automatically
- SBOM adoption is emerging practice — absence common in open-source
- Didn't check npm version (may not support `npm sbom` command)

**Scope Boundaries**:
- ✅ CAN claim: No SBOM files in repository
- ✅ CAN claim: No SBOM tools in package.json scripts
- ❌ CANNOT claim: Dependencies are untracked (GitHub Dependency Graph exists)
- ❌ CANNOT claim: SBOM is required for this project type

**How to Confirm**:
1. **Check npm version**: `npm --version` — needs 9.6+ for built-in SBOM support
2. **Check CI artifacts**: Review GitHub Actions artifacts for SBOM files
3. **GitHub Dependency Graph**: Verify GitHub already tracks dependencies
4. **Expected outcome**: Likely not needed (GitHub provides dependency tracking)

**Recommendation**:
Low priority. To generate SBOM:
- Run `npm sbom --sbom-format=cyclonedx` (npm 9.6+)
- Add to CI pipeline if compliance required (supply chain security)
- Consider only if project used in regulated industries (healthcare, finance, gov)

---

#### U-5: Multiple package-lock.json Files (RISK-007)
**Domain**: Dev (risks)
**Current Confidence**: Tentative (0.70)
**Evidence**: E-DEV-062 (file count)
**Severity**: Low

**Current Understanding**:
Found 2+ `package-lock.json` files in repository:
- Root: `/package-lock.json`
- Website: `/website/docs/package-lock.json`
- Concern: Version conflicts or workspace misconfiguration

**Why Tentative**:
- Multiple lockfiles MAY be intentional (separate workspaces)
- Didn't verify if workspaces are properly configured
- May be legacy files (e.g., old location not cleaned up)
- Didn't check if both are actively used

**Scope Boundaries**:
- ✅ CAN claim: Multiple package-lock.json files exist
- ❌ CANNOT claim: This causes version conflicts
- ❌ CANNOT claim: Workspace configuration is incorrect
- ⚠️ SHOULD investigate: Whether structure is intentional

**How to Confirm**:
1. **List all lockfiles**: `find . -name "package-lock.json" -not -path "*/node_modules/*"`
2. **Check root package.json**: Verify `workspaces` field — if present, multiple lockfiles expected
3. **Check file timestamps**: If one is outdated, likely legacy cruft
4. **Test install**: `npm install` — does it error or warn?
5. **Expected outcome**: Likely intentional (root plugin + website docs as separate workspace)

**Recommendation**:
Verify workspace structure:
- If workspaces used: Document in CONTRIBUTING.md
- If NOT workspaces: Remove extra lockfile, use monorepo structure (npm workspaces or lerna)
- If legacy: Clean up old lockfile

---

#### U-6: No Staging Environment (F-DEPLOY-005)
**Domain**: Dev (deployment)
**Current Confidence**: Tentative (0.75)
**Evidence**: E-DEV-035 (absence)
**Severity**: Low

**Current Understanding**:
No staging environment detected:
- Deployment is direct to production (Cloudflare Pages)
- No preview URLs or pre-prod testing environment
- All changes go live immediately after merge

**Why Tentative**:
- Cloudflare Pages provides automatic preview deployments for PRs (may not be visible in repo config)
- GitHub Pages or Vercel may auto-create preview environments
- Didn't check Cloudflare Pages dashboard settings
- "Staging" may be branch-based (e.g., `dev` branch deploys to staging URL)

**Scope Boundaries**:
- ✅ CAN claim: No explicit staging environment in deployment config
- ❌ CANNOT claim: No preview deployments exist (may be automatic)
- ❌ CANNOT claim: All changes deploy directly to production (may have PR previews)

**How to Confirm**:
1. **Check Cloudflare Pages dashboard**: Look for preview deployments on PRs
2. **Review recent PRs**: Check PR comments for auto-generated preview URLs
3. **Check GitHub Actions workflow**: Look for environment variables (`ENVIRONMENT=staging`)
4. **Test PR workflow**: Create PR and observe if preview URL is generated
5. **Expected outcome**: Likely have automatic preview deployments (Cloudflare Pages default)

**Recommendation**:
Low risk for documentation site. To confirm:
- Document preview deployment process in CONTRIBUTING.md
- If no previews: Enable Cloudflare Pages preview deployments (free)
- If staging needed: Add branch-based deployment (`dev` → staging URL)

#### U-7: Unknown Test Coverage (F-TEST-004)
**Domain**: Dev (testing)
**Current Confidence**: Tentative (0.75)
**Evidence**: E-DEV-021 (absence)
**Severity**: Low

**Current Understanding**:
No test coverage metrics detected:
- No `nyc`, `istanbul`, `c8`, or `jest --coverage` in package.json
- No coverage badges in README
- No coverage reports in `.gitignore` or CI artifacts

**Why Tentative**:
- No testing framework = no coverage metrics possible (this is derivative of F-TEST-002)
- May have manual testing without metrics
- Coverage may be tracked externally (Codecov, Coveralls) without badge
- Didn't check if project policy is "no unit tests needed"

**Scope Boundaries**:
- ✅ CAN claim: No automated test coverage tooling
- ✅ CAN claim: No coverage metrics in repository
- ❌ CANNOT claim: Test coverage is 0% (no tests to measure)
- ⚠️ NOTE: Contingent on F-TEST-002 (no test framework)

**How to Confirm**:
1. **Resolve F-TEST-002 first**: If tests added, check for coverage tooling
2. **Check external services**: Codecov.io, Coveralls.io — project may be registered
3. **Review CI logs**: Check if coverage runs but isn't configured to report
4. **Expected outcome**: Coverage is N/A until testing framework implemented

**Recommendation**:
Blocked by F-TEST-002. Once tests implemented:
- Add coverage reporting (Jest has built-in coverage via `--coverage`)
- Set coverage threshold (e.g., 60% for critical paths)
- Add coverage badge to README

**Resolution Path**:
- Implement tests → Add coverage reporting → Upgrade to Confirmed
- Or: Document "No tests by design" → Upgrade to Confirmed with N/A status

#### U-8: Mixed Line Ending Configuration (F-STD-005)
**Domain**: Dev (standards)
**Current Confidence**: Tentative (0.70)
**Evidence**: E-DEV-014 (config analysis)
**Severity**: Low

**Current Understanding**:
`.editorconfig` has inconsistent line ending configuration:
- Some sections specify `end_of_line = lf`
- Other sections inherit default (may differ by developer OS)
- Shell scripts have `end_of_line = lf` (correct)
- Markdown/JS files may vary

**Why Tentative**:
- Didn't check actual files for CRLF vs. LF (only checked config)
- Git may normalize line endings via `.gitattributes` (didn't check)
- Modern editors handle mixed line endings gracefully
- May not cause issues in practice

**Scope Boundaries**:
- ✅ CAN claim: `.editorconfig` lacks explicit `end_of_line` for some file types
- ❌ CANNOT claim: Files have mixed line endings (need to scan files)
- ❌ CANNOT claim: This causes runtime errors (shell scripts are explicitly LF)

**How to Confirm**:
1. **Check .gitattributes**: `cat .gitattributes` — look for `* text=auto` or `* eol=lf`
2. **Scan for CRLF**: `find . -not -path "*/node_modules/*" -type f -exec file {} \; | grep CRLF`
3. **Review .editorconfig**: Verify each `[*.ext]` section has `end_of_line = lf`
4. **Test on Windows**: Clone repo on Windows and check if files convert to CRLF
5. **Expected outcome**: Likely non-issue (git handles normalization)

**Recommendation**:
Low priority (cosmetic issue). To fix:
- Add `end_of_line = lf` globally in `.editorconfig`:
  ```ini
  [*]
  end_of_line = lf
  ```
- Or add `.gitattributes`:
  ```
  * text=auto eol=lf
  ```

#### U-9: Missing Build Optimization Analysis (F-STACK-011)
**Domain**: Dev (stack)
**Current Confidence**: Tentative (0.65)
**Evidence**: E-DEV-011 (absence)
**Severity**: Low

**Current Understanding**:
No build optimization analysis detected:
- No bundle size tracking (bundlesize, size-limit)
- No build performance metrics
- No tree-shaking verification
- Docusaurus build may not be optimized

**Why Tentative**:
- Docusaurus has built-in optimizations (webpack/rspack) — didn't verify config
- Bundle size may be acceptable without explicit tracking
- Static site generator = less critical than SPA (no runtime bundle size impact)
- Didn't check actual build output size or page load metrics

**Scope Boundaries**:
- ✅ CAN claim: No bundle size tooling in package.json
- ❌ CANNOT claim: Build is unoptimized (Docusaurus may optimize by default)
- ❌ CANNOT claim: Page load performance is poor (need metrics)

**How to Confirm**:
1. **Check build output**: `npm run build` and review `website/docs/build/` size
2. **Lighthouse audit**: Run on deployed site (https://jaan.to) — check performance score
3. **Bundle analyzer**: Add `@docusaurus/plugin-webpack-bundler` with `bundleAnalyzer: true`
4. **Page load test**: Measure Time to Interactive (TTI) on production
5. **Expected outcome**: Likely already optimized by Docusaurus defaults

**Recommendation**:
Low priority (documentation site, not web app). To confirm optimization:
- Run Lighthouse audit (target: 90+ performance score)
- Check build output size (docs sites typically <5MB)
- If issues found: Enable Docusaurus production mode optimizations

**Resolution Path**:
- Run Lighthouse → If 90+, mark as "Optimized by default"
- If <90: Investigate bundle size, code splitting, image optimization

#### U-10: No Architecture Documentation Diagram (F-ARCH-009)
**Domain**: Dev (architecture)
**Current Confidence**: Tentative (0.80) — *borderline Firm*
**Evidence**: E-DEV-018 (absence)
**Severity**: Low

**Current Understanding**:
No architecture diagram detected:
- No C4 model diagrams
- No sequence diagrams
- No component relationship visualizations
- Only prose documentation (CLAUDE.md, README.md, docs/)

**Why Tentative (borderline)**:
- Confidence is 0.80 (just above Tentative threshold of 0.79)
- Did check for common diagram formats (`.drawio`, `.mermaid`, `.puml`)
- May have external diagrams (Figma, Miro, Lucidchart) not in repo
- CLI plugin architecture may be simple enough to not warrant diagrams

**Scope Boundaries**:
- ✅ CAN claim: No architecture diagrams in repository
- ❌ CANNOT claim: Architecture is undocumented (prose exists)
- ❌ CANNOT claim: Diagrams are required (may be unnecessary for simple architecture)

**How to Confirm**:
1. **Check docs folder**: `find docs/ website/ -name "*.png" -o -name "*.svg" -o -name "*.drawio"` — look for architecture diagrams
2. **Review README/docs**: Check if external diagrams linked (Figma, Miro, etc.)
3. **Assess complexity**: For 26 skills + 2 agents + 4 hooks, diagram may be helpful but not critical
4. **Expected outcome**: Likely intentionally absent (architecture simple enough for prose)

**Recommendation**:
Low priority. Consider adding diagram if:
- Project grows to 50+ skills (harder to understand relationships)
- External contributors struggle with architecture
- Complex inter-skill dependencies emerge

**Resolution Path**:
- Document as "Not needed — architecture documented in prose (CLAUDE.md, docs/)"
- Or: Create simple C4 Context/Container diagram if helpful for onboarding
- Upgrade to Confirmed with finding status: "Architecture documented via prose, diagrams not required"

**Total Unknowns**: 10 (all from Dev domain)
**Confidence Distribution**:
- Uncertain (< 0.65): 2
- Tentative (0.65-0.79): 8

**Key Themes**:
1. **Security posture** (5 unknowns): Pentesting, signed commits, elevated privileges, SBOM, dependency tracking
2. **Testing gaps** (1 unknown): Coverage metrics (contingent on implementing tests)
3. **Configuration issues** (2 unknowns): Multiple lockfiles, mixed line endings
4. **Documentation** (2 unknowns): Staging environment, architecture diagrams

**Recommended Investigation Order**:
1. **U-3** (Shell privileges) — Medium severity, security concern
2. **U-5** (Multiple lockfiles) — May indicate misconfiguration
3. **U-6** (Staging environment) — Check Cloudflare Pages settings
4. **U-8** (Line endings) — Quick fix via `.gitattributes`
5. **U-1, U-2, U-4, U-7, U-9, U-10** — Low priority, mostly informational

**Expected Outcomes**:
- Most unknowns likely to resolve as "N/A" or "Not needed for project scope"
- U-3, U-5, U-8 may require actual fixes
- U-6 likely already handled by Cloudflare Pages preview deployments

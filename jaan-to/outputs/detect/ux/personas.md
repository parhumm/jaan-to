# UX Personas Detection Report

## Executive Summary

No UI/TUI detected for platform 'all'. UX audit (route mapping, user flows, persona inference, heuristic assessment) is not applicable to this platform type.

**Repository Type**: CLI plugin/tool (jaan-to for Claude Code)
**Analysis Scope**: User personas inferred from route structure and authentication patterns
**Result**: Not applicable — no user-facing interface detected

## Scope and Methodology

### Analysis Approach

1. **Framework Detection**: Scanned for UI frameworks (React, Vue, Angular, Next.js)
2. **Component Analysis**: Searched for UI component files (.jsx, .tsx, .vue, .svelte)
3. **TUI Detection**: Checked for terminal UI libraries (blessed, ink, bubbletea, charm)
4. **Persona Inference**: Intended to infer personas from route structure, auth patterns, and feature areas

### Limitations

- This is a **CLI tool/plugin** — personas are typically developer-focused rather than UI-based
- No interactive user interface detected beyond static marketing website
- Persona analysis is designed for applications with user authentication flows, dashboards, and role-based access

## Findings

### E-UX-001: No UI/TUI Detected

**Severity**: Informational
**Confidence**: Confirmed (1.0)

**Description**: Platform 'all' does not contain UI components (.jsx, .tsx, .vue, .svelte) or TUI libraries. Persona inference from UI patterns is not applicable to this platform type.

**Evidence**:

```yaml
evidence:
  id: E-UX-001
  type: absence
  confidence: 1.0
  method: glob-pattern-match
  description: "No UI/TUI files found in repository"
  details:
    - "Searched for: *.jsx, *.tsx, *.vue, *.svelte (outside node_modules)"
    - "Searched for: blessed, ink, bubbletea, charm in package.json/go.mod"
    - "Result: No UI framework or TUI library detected"
    - "Repository structure: skills/, agents/, hooks/, scripts/ (CLI plugin)"
```

## Recommendations

### For CLI Tools

While UI-based persona analysis is not applicable, consider these alternative approaches:

1. **Developer Personas**: Document target user types (e.g., product managers, developers, QA engineers) in your README or documentation
2. **Use Case Scenarios**: Define common workflows and skill invocation patterns
3. **User Research**: Gather feedback from actual plugin users to understand their roles, pain points, and workflows

### Alternative Analysis

For CLI tools like this one, consider:
- **Developer Experience (DX) audit** — command ergonomics, error messages, help text
- **Documentation audit** — getting started guides, skill reference, examples
- **Command discoverability** — how users learn about available skills

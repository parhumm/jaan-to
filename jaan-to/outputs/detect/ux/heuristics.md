# UX Heuristics Assessment Report (Nielsen's 10)

## Executive Summary

No UI/TUI detected for platform 'all'. Nielsen's 10 usability heuristics assessment is not applicable to this platform type.

**Repository Type**: CLI plugin/tool (jaan-to for Claude Code)
**Analysis Scope**: Evaluation of UI against Nielsen's 10 usability heuristics
**Result**: Not applicable — no user-facing interface detected

## Scope and Methodology

### Analysis Approach

Nielsen's 10 heuristics are designed for **graphical user interfaces (GUI)** with visual elements, navigation, forms, and interactive components. This tool intended to evaluate:

1. **Visibility of system status** — Loading indicators, progress bars, status messages
2. **Match between system and real world** — Domain terminology, labels, copy
3. **User control and freedom** — Undo, cancel, back navigation
4. **Consistency and standards** — Component patterns, design tokens
5. **Error prevention** — Confirmation dialogs, validation, constraints
6. **Recognition rather than recall** — Navigation labels, autocomplete, search
7. **Flexibility and efficiency** — Keyboard shortcuts, customization
8. **Aesthetic and minimalist design** — Information density, visual hierarchy
9. **Error recovery** — Error messages with solutions, retry buttons
10. **Help and documentation** — Tooltips, help text, FAQ

### Limitations

- This is a **CLI tool/plugin** — heuristics for GUI do not directly apply
- No interactive UI detected beyond static marketing website
- Heuristic assessment requires visual UI components, navigation patterns, and form interactions

## Findings

### E-UX-001: No UI/TUI Detected

**Severity**: Informational
**Confidence**: Confirmed (1.0)

**Description**: Platform 'all' does not contain UI components (.jsx, .tsx, .vue, .svelte) or TUI libraries. Nielsen's heuristics assessment for GUI is not applicable to this platform type.

**Evidence**:

```yaml
evidence:
  id: E-UX-001
  type: absence
  confidence: 1.0
  method: glob-pattern-match
  description: "No UI/TUI files found in repository"
  details:
    - "Searched for: *.jsx, *.tsx, *.vue, *.svelte (outside node_modules)"
    - "Searched for: blessed, ink, bubbletea, charm in package.json/go.mod"
    - "Result: No UI framework or TUI library detected"
    - "Repository structure: skills/, agents/, hooks/, scripts/ (CLI plugin)"
```

## Recommendations

### For CLI Tools

While GUI heuristics are not applicable, consider these **CLI/DX equivalents**:

| Nielsen Heuristic | CLI Equivalent |
|-------------------|----------------|
| **1. Visibility of system status** | Progress indicators, verbose output, status messages during long operations |
| **2. Match between system and real world** | Clear command names (e.g., `/pm-prd-write` not `/gen-doc-001`) |
| **3. User control and freedom** | Ctrl+C to cancel, `--dry-run` flags, undo commands |
| **4. Consistency and standards** | Consistent flag naming (`--output`, `--format`), predictable command structure |
| **5. Error prevention** | Confirmation prompts before destructive actions, input validation |
| **6. Recognition rather than recall** | Auto-completion, `/help` command, clear examples in docs |
| **7. Flexibility and efficiency** | Aliases for common commands, piping, batch operations |
| **8. Aesthetic and minimalist design** | Concise output, hide verbose logs behind `--verbose` flag |
| **9. Error recovery** | Clear error messages with solutions, `--help` on error |
| **10. Help and documentation** | Built-in help (`/help`), man pages, online docs with examples |

### Alternative Analysis

For CLI tools like this one, consider:
- **CLI usability testing** — observe users running skills for the first time
- **Command ergonomics review** — are flags intuitive? Is output readable?
- **Documentation audit** — is every skill documented with examples?

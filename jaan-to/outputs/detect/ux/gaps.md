# UX Gaps and Recommendations Report

## Executive Summary

No UI/TUI detected for platform 'all'. UX gap identification (missing flows, incomplete features, usability issues) is not applicable to this platform type.

**Repository Type**: CLI plugin/tool (jaan-to for Claude Code)
**Analysis Scope**: UX gaps inferred from incomplete flows, missing error states, dead ends
**Result**: Not applicable — no user-facing interface detected

## Scope and Methodology

### Analysis Approach

This assessment intended to identify **UX gaps** by analyzing:

1. **Incomplete User Flows**: Multi-step processes without completion paths
2. **Missing Error States**: Routes without error handling or recovery
3. **Navigation Dead Ends**: Pages without back navigation or escape routes
4. **Accessibility Gaps**: Missing ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, focus management
5. **Consistency Issues**: Inconsistent UI patterns, component naming, design tokens

### Limitations

- This is a **CLI tool/plugin** — UX gaps are DX (developer experience) gaps
- No interactive UI detected beyond static marketing website
- Gap analysis is designed for user-facing applications with flows, navigation, and interactions

## Findings

### E-UX-001: No UI/TUI Detected

**Severity**: Informational
**Confidence**: Confirmed (1.0)

**Description**: Platform 'all' does not contain UI components (.jsx, .tsx, .vue, .svelte) or TUI libraries. UX gap identification for visual UIs is not applicable to this platform type.

**Evidence**:

```yaml
evidence:
  id: E-UX-001
  type: absence
  confidence: 1.0
  method: glob-pattern-match
  description: "No UI/TUI files found in repository"
  details:
    - "Searched for: *.jsx, *.tsx, *.vue, *.svelte (outside node_modules)"
    - "Searched for: blessed, ink, bubbletea, charm in package.json/go.mod"
    - "Result: No UI framework or TUI library detected"
    - "Repository structure: skills/, agents/, hooks/, scripts/ (CLI plugin)"
```

## Recommendations

### For CLI Tools

While UI gap analysis is not applicable, consider these **DX (Developer Experience) gaps** for CLI tools:

#### 1. Onboarding Gaps
- **Gap**: New users may not know which skills are available
- **Recommendation**: Implement `/jaan-to:help` or `/jaan-to:list-skills` command
- **Priority**: High

#### 2. Error Recovery Gaps
- **Gap**: If a skill fails mid-execution, is the state recoverable?
- **Recommendation**: Document rollback procedures, implement `--resume` flag for long-running skills
- **Priority**: Medium

#### 3. Progress Feedback Gaps
- **Gap**: Do skills provide feedback during long operations?
- **Recommendation**: Add progress indicators ("Step 2 of 5: Analyzing routes...")
- **Priority**: Medium

#### 4. Validation Gaps
- **Gap**: Are input parameters validated before execution?
- **Recommendation**: Validate early, fail fast with clear error messages
- **Priority**: High

#### 5. Documentation Gaps
- **Gap**: Are all skills documented with real-world examples?
- **Recommendation**: Add "Quick Start" examples to docs for each skill
- **Priority**: High

#### 6. Discovery Gaps
- **Gap**: Users may not know when to use which skill
- **Recommendation**: Create workflow diagrams (e.g., "PRD workflow: research → prd-write → story-write → task-breakdown")
- **Priority**: Medium

#### 7. Feedback Loop Gaps
- **Gap**: How do users report issues or request features?
- **Recommendation**: Add `/jaan-to:feedback` skill or link to GitHub issues in help text
- **Priority**: Low

### Alternative Analysis

For CLI tools like this one, consider:

1. **DX Audit**: Conduct usability testing with developers unfamiliar with the plugin
2. **Competitive Analysis**: How do other CLI tools (e.g., `gh`, `vercel`, `stripe`) handle onboarding, help, and error messages?
3. **Analytics**: If possible, track which skills are used most often and where users get stuck
4. **Community Feedback**: Gather feedback from actual users via GitHub issues, Discord, or surveys

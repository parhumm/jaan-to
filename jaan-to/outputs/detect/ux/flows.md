# UX User Flows Detection Report

## Executive Summary

No UI/TUI detected for platform 'all'. User flow mapping from navigation patterns and route structures is not applicable to this platform type.

**Repository Type**: CLI plugin/tool (jaan-to for Claude Code)
**Analysis Scope**: User flows traced through navigation components and multi-step wizards
**Result**: Not applicable — no user-facing interface detected

## Scope and Methodology

### Analysis Approach

1. **Navigation Detection**: Intended to scan for `<Link>`, `<NavLink>`, `useNavigate()`, `router.push()`
2. **Flow Mapping**: Intended to trace which pages link to which other pages
3. **Multi-Step Detection**: Intended to identify wizards, checkout flows, onboarding sequences
4. **Diagram Generation**: Intended to create Mermaid flow diagrams for complex flows

### Limitations

- This is a **CLI tool/plugin** — user flows are command-based, not UI navigation-based
- No interactive UI detected beyond static marketing website
- Flow mapping is designed for applications with page transitions and navigation patterns

## Findings

### E-UX-001: No UI/TUI Detected

**Severity**: Informational
**Confidence**: Confirmed (1.0)

**Description**: Platform 'all' does not contain UI components (.jsx, .tsx, .vue, .svelte) or TUI libraries. User flow mapping from UI navigation is not applicable to this platform type.

**Evidence**:

```yaml
evidence:
  id: E-UX-001
  type: absence
  confidence: 1.0
  method: glob-pattern-match
  description: "No UI/TUI files found in repository"
  details:
    - "Searched for: *.jsx, *.tsx, *.vue, *.svelte (outside node_modules)"
    - "Searched for: blessed, ink, bubbletea, charm in package.json/go.mod"
    - "Result: No UI framework or TUI library detected"
    - "Repository structure: skills/, agents/, hooks/, scripts/ (CLI plugin)"
```

## Recommendations

### For CLI Tools

While UI flow mapping is not applicable, consider these alternative approaches:

1. **Command Flow Documentation**: Document common skill invocation sequences:
   ```mermaid
   graph LR
       A[/pm-research-about] --> B[/pm-prd-write]
       B --> C[/pm-story-write]
       C --> D[/dev-fe-task-breakdown]
   ```

2. **Two-Phase Workflow**: Document the analysis → approval → generation flow used by skills

3. **Integration Flows**: Map how skills interact with external files and tools:
   - Context files → Skill → Output files
   - Templates → Skill → Generated documents
   - Learning files → Skill → Improved outputs

### Alternative Analysis

For CLI tools like this one, consider:
- **Command dependency mapping** — which skills depend on outputs from other skills
- **File flow analysis** — trace input files through processing to output files
- **State machine modeling** — document skill execution states (pending, analyzing, generating, completed)

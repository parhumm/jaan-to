# UX Pain Points Detection Report

## Executive Summary

No UI/TUI detected for platform 'all'. Pain point detection from UI friction signals (error handling, loading states, form complexity) is not applicable to this platform type.

**Repository Type**: CLI plugin/tool (jaan-to for Claude Code)
**Analysis Scope**: UX friction signals from error states, loading patterns, dead ends
**Result**: Not applicable — no user-facing interface detected

## Scope and Methodology

### Analysis Approach

1. **Error Handling Patterns**: Intended to scan for `<ErrorBoundary>`, validation messages, retry patterns
2. **Loading Patterns**: Intended to check for `isLoading`, `<Skeleton>`, `<Spinner>`, `<Suspense>`
3. **Form Complexity**: Intended to count form fields, detect multi-step forms, check validation
4. **Dead Ends**: Intended to find routes without navigation back, error states without recovery

### Limitations

- This is a **CLI tool/plugin** — pain points are DX (developer experience) issues, not UI friction
- No interactive UI detected beyond static marketing website
- Pain point analysis is designed for user-facing applications with forms, navigation, and error states

## Findings

### E-UX-001: No UI/TUI Detected

**Severity**: Informational
**Confidence**: Confirmed (1.0)

**Description**: Platform 'all' does not contain UI components (.jsx, .tsx, .vue, .svelte) or TUI libraries. UI pain point detection is not applicable to this platform type.

**Evidence**:

```yaml
evidence:
  id: E-UX-001
  type: absence
  confidence: 1.0
  method: glob-pattern-match
  description: "No UI/TUI files found in repository"
  details:
    - "Searched for: *.jsx, *.tsx, *.vue, *.svelte (outside node_modules)"
    - "Searched for: blessed, ink, bubbletea, charm in package.json/go.mod"
    - "Result: No UI framework or TUI library detected"
    - "Repository structure: skills/, agents/, hooks/, scripts/ (CLI plugin)"
```

## Recommendations

### For CLI Tools

While UI pain point analysis is not applicable, consider these alternative **Developer Experience (DX) pain points**:

#### 1. Command Discoverability
- Are skills easy to discover? (e.g., `/help`, auto-completion, documentation)
- Are skill names intuitive? (e.g., `/jaan-to:pm-prd-write` is clear, but verbose)

#### 2. Error Messages
- Do error messages provide actionable guidance?
- Are validation failures clear about what went wrong and how to fix it?

#### 3. Feedback & Progress
- Do long-running skills provide progress updates?
- Is the two-phase workflow (analysis → approval → generation) clear to users?

#### 4. Setup & Configuration
- Is initial setup straightforward? (install, configure paths, set language)
- Are error messages during setup helpful?

#### 5. Documentation Gaps
- Are all skills documented with examples?
- Are common workflows (e.g., PRD → stories → tasks) explained?

### Alternative Analysis

For CLI tools like this one, consider:
- **DX audit** — error message quality, help text clarity, command ergonomics
- **User testing** — observe new users installing and using the plugin
- **Support ticket analysis** — what issues do users report most often?

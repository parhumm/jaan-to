# UX Jobs-to-be-Done Detection Report

## Executive Summary

No UI/TUI detected for platform 'all'. Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD) inference from UI features and user flows is not applicable to this platform type.

**Repository Type**: CLI plugin/tool (jaan-to for Claude Code)
**Analysis Scope**: JTBD statements inferred from feature areas and functional groupings
**Result**: Not applicable — no user-facing interface detected

## Scope and Methodology

### Analysis Approach

1. **Feature Area Mapping**: Intended to group routes into functional areas (auth, billing, content, settings)
2. **JTBD Construction**: Intended to create statements: "When {situation}, I want to {motivation}, so I can {expected outcome}"
3. **Evidence Linking**: Intended to link each JTBD to specific routes and components

### Limitations

- This is a **CLI tool/plugin** — JTBD analysis is designed for user-facing applications
- No interactive UI detected beyond static marketing website
- JTBD inference requires route structure, feature flows, and user workflows

## Findings

### E-UX-001: No UI/TUI Detected

**Severity**: Informational
**Confidence**: Confirmed (1.0)

**Description**: Platform 'all' does not contain UI components (.jsx, .tsx, .vue, .svelte) or TUI libraries. JTBD inference from UI features is not applicable to this platform type.

**Evidence**:

```yaml
evidence:
  id: E-UX-001
  type: absence
  confidence: 1.0
  method: glob-pattern-match
  description: "No UI/TUI files found in repository"
  details:
    - "Searched for: *.jsx, *.tsx, *.vue, *.svelte (outside node_modules)"
    - "Searched for: blessed, ink, bubbletea, charm in package.json/go.mod"
    - "Result: No UI framework or TUI library detected"
    - "Repository structure: skills/, agents/, hooks/, scripts/ (CLI plugin)"
```

## Recommendations

### For CLI Tools

While UI-based JTBD analysis is not applicable, consider these alternative approaches:

1. **Document Skill JTBD**: Each skill (e.g., `/jaan-to:pm-prd-write`, `/jaan-to:detect-dev`) serves a specific job — document these explicitly
2. **User Stories**: Collect actual use cases from plugin users:
   - "When I need to create a PRD, I want to generate it from a brief description, so I can save 2 hours of formatting work"
   - "When I audit a codebase, I want automated findings with evidence, so I can focus on fixing critical issues"
3. **Workflow Mapping**: Map skill invocation sequences (e.g., research → PRD → stories → tasks)

### Alternative Analysis

For CLI tools like this one, consider:
- **Command workflow analysis** — how skills chain together
- **Integration point mapping** — where skills read/write files, call external tools
- **Pain point interviews** — talk to actual users about their workflow bottlenecks

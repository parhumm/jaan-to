## Executive Summary

**Instrumentation**: **None detected**

The product has **no analytics**, **no feature flags**, and **no telemetry**:
- Analytics: None
- Event tracking: 0 events
- Feature flags: None
- Error tracking: None

**Context**: As a **local CLI tool**, lack of instrumentation is intentional and privacy-respecting.

## Findings

### F-MTR-001: No Analytics Detected

**Severity**: Informational
**Confidence**: Confirmed (1.00)

```yaml
evidence:
  id: E-PRD-036
  type: absence
  confidence: 1.00
  location:
    uri: "."
    analysis: |
      No analytics SDKs detected:

      Plugin code (skills/, scripts/):
      - Google Analytics (gtag): 0 results
      - Mixpanel: 0 results
      - Segment: 0 results
      - PostHog: 0 results
      - Amplitude: 0 results
      - Plausible: 0 results

      Documentation site has analytics in node_modules (type definitions),
      but no actual usage in source code.
  method: pattern-match
```

**Description**: **No user behavior tracking**:
- No skill usage metrics
- No error tracking (Sentry, Rollbar)
- No performance monitoring
- No A/B testing

**Impact**: **Neutral** — Privacy-first approach appropriate for local dev tools. However, maintainer has no visibility into:
- Which skills are most used
- Error rates
- Adoption metrics

**Recommendation (Low Priority)**: Consider **opt-in telemetry** with:
- Clear disclosure in README
- Easy opt-out mechanism
- Privacy-focused analytics (e.g., minimal event collection)

### F-MTR-002: No Feature Flags

**Severity**: Low
**Confidence**: Confirmed (0.95)

```yaml
evidence:
  id: E-PRD-037
  type: absence
  confidence: 0.95
  location:
    uri: "."
    analysis: |
      No feature flag platforms detected:
      - LaunchDarkly: 0 results
      - Unleash: 0 results
      - Split.io: 0 results
      - Flagsmith: 0 results
      - Custom flags (FEATURE_, FF_): 0 results

      Feature rollout is via plugin versioning, not runtime flags.
  method: pattern-match
```

**Description**: **No runtime feature toggles**:
- New skills are shipped in plugin versions (e.g., v3.24.0)
- No gradual rollout mechanism
- No A/B testing of skill implementations

**Impact**: **Minor** — All users on a given version have same feature set. No ability to:
- Canary test new skills
- Gradually roll out risky changes
- A/B test different prompts

**Recommendation (Low Priority)**: Feature flags not essential for a CLI tool. Version-based releases are adequate.

## Recommendations

### Priority 3 (Low)
1. **Consider opt-in telemetry** — Track skill usage to prioritize improvements (F-MTR-001)
2. **Feature flags optional** — Only needed if canary testing becomes important (F-MTR-002)

## Executive Summary

**Technical Constraints**: **Minimal**

The product has **no usage limits**, **no rate limiting**, and **no artificial constraints**:
- Runs entirely locally (no API quotas)
- No file size limits
- No user/seat limits
- No geo-restrictions

**Only constraint**: Requires **Claude Code installation** (the host platform).

## Findings

### F-CON-001: No Technical Constraints

**Severity**: Informational
**Confidence**: Confirmed (0.98)

```yaml
evidence:
  id: E-PRD-038
  type: absence
  confidence: 0.98
  location:
    uri: "."
    analysis: |
      No technical limits detected:

      Code searches:
      - rateLimit: 0 results (except node_modules)
      - throttle: 0 results
      - maxFileSize: 0 results
      - MAX_UPLOAD: 0 results
      - fileSizeLimit: 0 results
      - maxUsers: 0 results
      - seatLimit: 0 results
      - teamSize: 0 results

      Plugin executes locally with no API calls to external services.
  method: pattern-match
```

**Description**: **No usage restrictions**:
- Unlimited skill executions
- No file size limits for inputs
- No concurrent user limits
- No throttling or rate limiting

**Constraint Source**: Only limit is Claude Code's own runtime constraints (token limits, execution timeouts).

**Impact**: **Positive** — Users can execute skills as many times as needed without artificial limits.

### F-CON-002: Platform Dependency — Requires Claude Code

**Severity**: Informational
**Confidence**: Confirmed (1.00)

```yaml
evidence:
  id: E-PRD-039
  type: dependency
  confidence: 1.00
  location:
    uri: ".claude-plugin/plugin.json"
    analysis: |
      Product is a Claude Code plugin, requiring:
      - Claude Code CLI installation
      - Compatible version of Claude API access

      Distribution: Via Claude plugin marketplace
      Installation: Via `/plugin install` command
  method: manifest-analysis
```

**Description**: The **only hard constraint** is Claude Code platform dependency:
- Users must have Claude Code installed
- Cannot be used standalone (not a standalone CLI tool)
- Version compatibility with Claude Code required

**Impact**: **Neutral** — Platform dependency is intentional (plugin architecture). Users in Claude Code ecosystem have seamless access.

---

## Recommendations

None. Constraint model (platform dependency only) is appropriate for a plugin.

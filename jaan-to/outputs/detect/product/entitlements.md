**Description**: **No access restrictions** on any feature:
- All skills run locally in Claude Code runtime
- No authentication API calls
- No tier-based feature gating
- No usage tracking or quotas

**Access Control**: Implicitly controlled by Claude Code installation (if user has Claude Code, they can use the plugin).

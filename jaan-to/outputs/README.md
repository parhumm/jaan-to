# jaan.to Outputs

> All generated outputs organized by role and type.

---

## Overview

This directory contains all outputs generated by jaan.to skills. Each output is stored in a numbered folder with a descriptive slug and includes an executive summary for quick reference.

## Organization

### Structure Pattern

```
jaan-to/outputs/{role}/{subdomain}/{id}-{slug}/
  ├── {id}-{report-type}-{slug}.md    # Main file
  └── {id}-{aux-type}-{slug}.md       # Optional auxiliary files
```

### Key Features

- **Per-subdomain sequential IDs**: Each subdomain (e.g., `pm/prd`, `pm/stories`) has its own ID sequence starting at 01
- **Folder-based outputs**: Each output gets its own folder to support multiple related files
- **Consistent file naming**: All files use `{id}-{report-type}-{slug}.md` pattern
- **Automatic indexing**: Each subdomain has a README.md with table of contents and executive summaries
- **Reusable slugs**: Same slug (e.g., "user-auth") can exist across different role/subdomain combinations

### Example

```
jaan-to/outputs/
  ├── pm/
  │   ├── prd/
  │   │   ├── README.md
  │   │   ├── 01-user-auth/
  │   │   │   ├── 01-prd-user-auth.md
  │   │   │   └── 01-prd-tasks-user-auth.md
  │   │   └── 02-payment-flow/
  │   │       └── 02-prd-payment-flow.md
  │   └── stories/
  │       ├── README.md
  │       └── 01-user-auth/
  │           └── 01-story-user-auth.md
  ├── data/
  │   └── gtm/
  │       ├── README.md
  │       └── 01-user-auth/
  │           └── 01-gtm-user-auth.md
  └── research/
      ├── README.md
      └── 01-category-slug.md  (flat structure)
```

Note how "user-auth" appears across `pm/prd`, `pm/stories`, and `data/gtm` — this is intentional for cross-role feature tracking.

## Roles

### [Product Management](pm/)
PRDs, user stories, roadmaps, and product specifications.

**Subdomains:**
- `pm/prd/` - Product Requirements Documents
- `pm/stories/` - User Stories

### [Data Analytics](data/)
GTM tracking implementations and analytics configurations.

**Subdomains:**
- `data/gtm/` - Google Tag Manager dataLayer tracking code

### [Development](dev/)
Technical task breakdowns and stack detection.

**Subdomains:**
- `dev/frontend/` - Frontend task breakdowns
- `dev/backend/` - Backend task breakdowns
- `dev/stack/` - Technology stack detection reports

### [UX Research](ux/)
Heatmap analysis and user research findings.

**Subdomains:**
- `ux/heatmap/` - Heatmap analysis reports

### [Research](research/)
Deep research summaries on various topics.

**Note:** Research outputs use a flat file structure (`{id}-{category}-{slug}.md`) rather than folders, due to high volume and simpler needs.

## Navigation

### Browse by Role
- **Product Work**: Start with [pm/prd/README.md](pm/prd/README.md) for product requirements
- **User Stories**: See [pm/stories/README.md](pm/stories/README.md) for user stories
- **Tracking Code**: Visit [data/gtm/README.md](data/gtm/README.md) for GTM implementations
- **Dev Tasks**: Check [dev/frontend/README.md](dev/frontend/README.md) or [dev/backend/README.md](dev/backend/README.md)
- **UX Insights**: Browse [ux/heatmap/README.md](ux/heatmap/README.md)
- **Research**: Explore [research/README.md](research/README.md)

### Search by Feature
Since slugs are reusable across roles, you can track a feature across different output types:
1. Find PRD: `pm/prd/{id}-{feature-name}/`
2. Find stories: `pm/stories/{id}-{feature-name}/`
3. Find tracking: `data/gtm/{id}-{feature-name}/`
4. Find tasks: `dev/frontend/{id}-{feature-name}/` or `dev/backend/{id}-{feature-name}/`

## Standards

All outputs follow the [jaan.to Output Structure Standards](../docs/extending/create-skill.md#skill-output-standards):

1. ✅ Sequential IDs per subdomain
2. ✅ Folder-per-output structure
3. ✅ Consistent file naming with ID prefix
4. ✅ Executive summary in every output
5. ✅ Automatic index updates

## What is Jaanify?

Jaanify is a transparent AI task manager designed for neurodivergent individuals, freelancers, and solopreneurs. Unlike black-box AI tools that only tell you *what* to do, Jaanify shows you *why* — through **3-Tier Reasoning Cards**:

| Tier | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Glance** | Quick summary of the recommendation |
| **Explore** | Underlying factors and trade-offs |
| **Audit** | Complete reasoning chain for full transparency |

This progressive disclosure system lets users engage with AI recommendations at the depth they choose — from a quick glance to a full audit trail.

### Key Features
- Natural language task input (text + voice)
- AI daily planner with visible factor analysis
- PWA-first architecture with offline support
- 60-second onboarding

## The Co-Evolution Loop

Jaanify and jaan.to develop together through structured cycles:

```
Scan → Review & Test → Build → Gap Report → repeat
```

Each cycle follows the same pattern:

1. **Scan** — jaan.to skills analyze the current state of the Jaanify project
2. **Review & Test** — Generated artifacts (PRDs, test cases, components) are validated against real requirements
3. **Build** — Gaps and improvements are implemented in both projects
4. **Gap Report** — Findings feed back into jaan.to skill improvements

This loop has driven three completed cycles, evolving jaan.to from v3.15.2 through v3.19.0 — each cycle improving both the plugin's skills and Jaanify's deliverables.

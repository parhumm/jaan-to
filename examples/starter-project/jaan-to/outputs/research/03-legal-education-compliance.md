## Executive Summary

Educational technology platforms must navigate complex, evolving privacy regulations to protect student data:

1. **2025 COPPA amendments require immediate action**: FTC published final COPPA Rule amendments effective June 23, 2025, with full compliance required by April 22, 2026. First major updates since 2013 significantly expand requirements. *[Verified by multiple sources]*

2. **Civil penalties now exceed $53,000 per violation**: Operators who violate COPPA can face civil penalties up to $53,088 per violation, making non-compliance extremely costly for EdTech platforms serving children under 13.

3. **Formal security programs now mandatory**: 2025 amendments require written, formal security programs tailored to data sensitivity, elevating security from best practice to legal requirement.

4. **FERPA-COPPA overlap creates complexity**: Both laws protect students but cover different aspects - FERPA governs educational records schools maintain, while COPPA regulates online platform interactions with children under 13.

5. **Third-party sharing requires explicit consent**: Platforms must obtain verifiable parental consent before sharing children's personal information with third parties for targeted advertising, with specific third-party disclosure required.

## Background Context

The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) was enacted in 1998 and took effect in 2000 to protect children under 13 from predatory online data collection practices. The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) was enacted in 1974 to protect student education records.

COPPA focuses on online services "directed to children" (under 13) or services with actual knowledge they're collecting data from children. FERPA applies to educational institutions receiving federal funding and governs access to and disclosure of student education records.

Educational technology represents a unique intersection where both laws apply simultaneously, creating compliance challenges for developers, schools, and service providers.

## Key Findings: 2025 COPPA Amendments

### Timeline and Compliance Deadlines

- **Rule Published**: FTC published final amendments to COPPA Rule
- **Effective Date**: June 23, 2025
- **Full Compliance Deadline**: April 22, 2026
- **Significance**: First major COPPA updates since 2013

### Major Changes

**1. Enhanced Parental Notice and Consent**

Websites and online services directed at children must now obtain verifiable parental consent before sharing children's personal information with third parties for targeted advertising or other purposes, with parents being notified of the specific third parties receiving their child's data.

**Key Requirements**:
- Explicit consent for third-party data sharing
- Named disclosure of specific third-party recipients
- Purpose-specific consent (e.g., "for targeted advertising")
- Cannot bundle consent with general terms of service

**2. Expanded Definitions**

Updates include expanded definitions of:
- **"Personal information"**: Now includes additional data types
- **"Online contact information"**: Broader than previous definition
- **"Mixed audience" services**: New standards for platforms serving both children and adults

**3. Mandatory Formal Security Programs**

The 2025 COPPA amendments require formal, written security programs tailored to the sensitivity of data. This moves security from recommended best practice to mandatory legal requirement.

**Security Program Requirements**:
- Written, documented security policies
- Risk assessments specific to children's data
- Incident response procedures
- Regular security audits
- Employee training on data protection

**4. Enhanced Data Retention and Deletion**

Stricter data retention and security obligations require:
- Time-limited data retention (retain only as long as necessary)
- Secure deletion procedures
- Parent-initiated deletion rights
- Audit trails for data lifecycle

## Key Findings: FERPA Requirements

### Core FERPA Principles

FERPA gives parents (or students over 18) rights to:
1. **Inspect and review** student education records
2. **Request amendments** to incorrect or misleading records
3. **Consent to disclosures** of personally identifiable information (with exceptions)
4. **File complaints** with the U.S. Department of Education

### Educational Technology Context

FERPA focuses on educational records schools already maintain, while COPPA governs what happens when students interact with online platforms and services. When districts implement AI tools or EdTech platforms, both laws shape what data can be collected and how vendors must handle it.

### School Exception for EdTech

Historically, the FTC provided guidance permitting schools to authorize the collection of personal information on behalf of parents for educational technology services. However, the 2025 amendments deliberately avoided codifying this exception:

The FTC did not codify its long-standing guidance permitting schools to authorize data collection on behalf of parents for educational technology services, explaining it avoided making amendments that could conflict with upcoming potential changes to FERPA regulations.

**Implication**: Schools and EdTech vendors should not assume the "school exception" will continue in its current form and should prepare for potential changes to FERPA regulations.

### 2025 FERPA Compliance Certification

In March 2025, the Department of Education required all state agencies to certify FERPA compliance by April 30, 2025, signaling increased enforcement priority.

## Implementation Checklist

### Immediate Actions (By April 22, 2026)

**COPPA Compliance**:
- [ ] Review and update privacy policy with expanded definitions
- [ ] Implement enhanced parental consent mechanisms
- [ ] Create formal written security program
- [ ] Update third-party disclosure procedures
- [ ] Establish data retention and deletion policies
- [ ] Train staff on 2025 amendments
- [ ] Conduct security audit

**FERPA Compliance**:

- [ ] Implement data breach notification procedures

### Verifiable Parental Consent Methods

FTC-approved methods include:
1. **Credit card verification**: Small charge reversed
2. **Government-issued ID**: Verified against database
3. **Video conference**: Real-time verification with parent
4. **Postal mail**: Signed consent form mailed back
5. **Digital signature**: PKI-based verification
6. **Face recognition**: Biometric parent verification

**Note**: Email consent alone is NOT sufficient under COPPA.

### Data Minimization Best Practices

1. **Collect only necessary data**: Justify each data point collected
2. **Purpose limitation**: Use data only for stated purposes
3. **Time-limited retention**: Delete when no longer needed
4. **Anonymization when possible**: De-identify data for analytics
5. **Segregate child data**: Separate systems for under-13 users

---

## Open Questions and Challenges

1. **AI and Machine Learning**: How do COPPA/FERPA apply to AI model training on student data? Are de-identified training datasets truly anonymous?

2. **Third-party integrations**: How should platforms handle complex ecosystems with dozens of integrated services?

3. **International students**: How do GDPR, COPPA, and FERPA interact for platforms serving global audiences?

4. **School exception uncertainty**: Will FTC/DOE coordination clarify or restrict the school's ability to consent on behalf of parents?

5. **Age verification accuracy**: What margin of error is acceptable for age-gating mechanisms?

## Conclusion

The 2025 COPPA amendments represent the most significant update to children's online privacy regulations in over a decade, requiring EdTech platforms to overhaul consent, security, and data handling practices by April 22, 2026.

Platforms serving educational institutions must navigate dual compliance with both COPPA (for children under 13) and FERPA (for educational records), with potential penalties exceeding $53,000 per violation for COPPA non-compliance.

Immediate priorities for EdTech developers:
1. Implement formal written security programs (new COPPA requirement)
2. Update parental consent mechanisms for third-party data sharing
3. Review and update vendor contracts for FERPA compliance
4. Train staff on 2025 regulatory changes
5. Conduct compliance audits before April 2026 deadline

The regulatory landscape continues evolving, with anticipated changes to FERPA regulations and ongoing FTC enforcement priorities. Platforms should establish ongoing compliance monitoring rather than one-time remediation.
